  <h2>BIOGRAPHY-<em>"This is the city I first remember seeing..."</em></h2>
    <h3>I grew up until first grade real close to
  this <em>SKYLINE</em>. Later moved to Irving, Tx Old home of our Dallas Cowboys where I finished High
  School in 2005. After Graduating from MacArthur High School I continued to learn, but it was more about
life skills. Commuting through the huge DFW Metroplex is similar to the current city I live in CDMX,
just not as many people. I learned skills such as <em>HVAC, CARPENTRY, PLUMBING, ELECTRICITY etc... ALSO
GAINING SKILLS IN THE CULINARY ARTS. "In Banquet Kitchen of the Omni Hotel"----></em></h3>
